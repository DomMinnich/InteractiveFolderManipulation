# InteractiveFolderManipulation

Interactive batch file GUI to help with folder manipulation on a larger scale. 
Use this to make a subfolder for many folders with one click.
Some of the folder's actions (like creating a folder) were intended for a person's name hence the (First Last) but feel free to use any naming structure.
